[+] NETWORK ARCHITECTURE:

* Networking is a way in which two computers/ machines communicate with each other
* At the physical level, networking devices include Physical devices that create the conenction and the devices that connect to them
* Multiple devices are connected together to a machine via Hubs / Switches
* In large organisations, Routers are used as a communication mean between sub networks ( Eg: The Internet)
* A barrier is placed in between the orgainisations network and the Internet in form of a FireWall
* To defend a network, a clear understaning of how computers communicate is necessary 
* The way in which the physical devices of networks communicate with each other forms the Network Architecture


[+] DATA PACKETS:

* When the connection is established with the network (by means of physical / wireless connection) the data must be sent over it
* Identify where the Data has to be sent, Every networking device has an IP which acts as an Address to for devlivering the data
* Just like a Postman(network) delivering the letter(data) based upon the address on the envelope(IP)
* The data to be transmitted across the network is in Binary, these are converted into packets with the size not greater than 65,000 Bytes/ 65KB
* The first part of the packet header contains where the data comes from, where the destinatioin is, and how many datas are yet to be transmitted
* The actual data is encapsulated underneath the packet headers
* The most common packet headers are: 
      >_ IP Header
      >_ TCP Header
      >_ Ethernet Header
* The IP header has the IP information of the Source and Destination
* The TCP Header has the information of the PORT
* The Ethernet header has the information of MAC addresses if both Source and Destination
* If the packet is encrypted with TLS (Transport Layer Security) the packets will have an additional header of TLS header


[+] IP ADDRESSES:

* There are two types of IP addressing Versions, IPv4 & IPv6
* IP version 4 & IP version 6
* IPv4 is widely used in present, The IPv4 address is a serious of four bit Three digit numbers.
* The three digits ranges from 0 - 255 
    >_ 192.168.12.6 = Vailid IPv4  = ranges betwen (0-255) = True
    >_ 192.168.0.277 = InValid IPv4 = ranges betwen (0-255) = False
* The four bit numbers are actually four Binary Numbers
* The First three digits of the IP address gives the information about the Class it belongs to
* There are 5 Class types, Class A, B, C, D, and E
* IP addresses with first 8 bits ranging from 0 - 126 falls in Class A and belongs to Large Networks
* IP addresses with first 8 bits ranging from 128 - 191 falls in Class B belongs to Large Corps and Govern Networks
* IP addresses with first 8 bits ranging from 192 - 223 falls in Class C belongs to Most commnon group of IPs
* IP addresses with first 8 bits ranging from 224 - 247 falls in Class D belongs to BroadCasting Services
* IP addresses with first 8 bits ranging from 248 - 255 falls in Class E belongs to Experimental Use
* The IP range 127 isn't mentioned as it locates to the current machine you are working on
* In Class A, the first octect represents the Network and remaining 3 octects represent the node
* In Class B, the first two octects represent the Network and the remaining represents the node
* In Class C, the first Three octects represent the Network and the last octact represents the node
* Private IP's are designated for the use within the network, these can't be used as public IP
    >_ 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    >_ 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    >_ 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
* Public IP's are unique
* Communication within the network of an company/ orgainisation is done via its private IP(The IP you will see in the RUN dialoge box of your college System if it is conneceted via LAN)
* When the computer makes request to the Internet, the Public IP is used
* Network Address Translation (NAT), where the router replaces the Private IP of the outgoing Packets with the Public IP so that the packet is routed throughout the internet
* Subnetting, splitting the available possible networks to a smaller portion (dividing it into smaller sub-networks)
* IPv6 uses 128 bit addressing unlike IPv4 which uses 32 bit
* IPv6 is a hex addressing address. Subnetting is not available in IPv6


[+] UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR (URL):

* The Computer/ ISP, translates the website you entered in a human readable format (www.github.com) is converetd into IP Address
* The DNS (DOMAIN NAME SERVICE) takes part in the conversion from human readable format to IP address
* The Domain name is converted into its corresponding IP and the browser requests to that IP on port 80
* If the target server has server like softwares that responds, then the connection is established
* The server responds to the clinet based on different scenarios, based on the Response Codes


[+] MAC ADDRESSES:

* MAC addresses are unique addresses for the Network Interface Card (NIC)
* Six byte hexa-decimal number
* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) converts IP to MAC Address
* When a web request is made, the DNS translates domain name to IP and the ARP translates the IP to MAC of a specific NIC
* MAC is a 48 bit address, the first 3 bytes are known as Organisatioin Unique Identifier (OUI) and is used to identify the manufacturer
* The remaining bytes are assigned by the Vendor


[+] Protocols:

* Protocols are the means that the computers communicate with the same service
* Protocols are like the language, Communication can be done effectively only with the people who understands it completely
* Most Common Protocols are
  >_ 20,21 - FTP Protocols (File Transfer)
  >_    22 - SSH Protocol (Secure Shell Protocol)
  >_    23 - TELNET Protocol (Remote Login)
  >_    25 - SMTP Protocol (Sending Mail)
  >_    43 - WhoIS Protocol (for querying)
  >_    53 - DNS Protocol (Domain name conversion)
  >_    69 - TFTP Protocol (Unrealiable FTP protocol)
  >_    80 - HTTP Protocol (Web Pages)
  >_   101 - POP3 Protocol (Recieving Mail)
  >_   194 - IRC Protocol (Chat Room)
  >_   443 - HTTPS Protocol (Encrypted HTTP)
  >_   445 - SMB Protocol (Microsoft Active Directory)
  >_    xx - ICMP Protocol (Simple packets containing error messages)
  
  [+] OSI MODEL:
  
  * This layer is used in implementing the internet
  * Has 7 Layers
  * Application layer directly interfaces with the application and performs common application services
  * Ports involved: POP, SMTP, HTTP, DNS, FTP etc..,
  * Presentaion layer relives the Application layer regarding data differences for the end user actions like data encryption, decryption, translation takes place here
  * Ports involved: NDR, LPP
  * Session layer provides mechanism for end-user application process
  * Ports involved: NetBIOS
  * Transport layer provides end-to-end communication control
  * Ports involved: TCP, UDP
  * Network layer routes information accross the network
  * Ports involved: IP, ARP, ICMP
  * Data Link Layer links physical with Network layer has the MAC addressing
  * Ports involved: MAC
  * Physical layer has the information about the various communication media
  * Devices like NIC and ethernet cables falls under this layer
