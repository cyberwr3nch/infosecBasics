[+] FIREWALL:

* A fence between the internal network of an organisation and the outside world (Internet)
* Basically protects the internal network from being exploited
* Filteration methods include Packet filtering, Stateful Packet Inspection Filtering, Client Application Auth & User Auth
* Reads packet size, source IP address, protocol, and destination port of the incoming IP packet
* Operating Systems home editions and server editions export with built in firewall to protect the network


[+] PACKET FILTERING FIREWALL:

* Most basic type of firewall, examines all incoming packets
* Only the packets with specified criteria are allowed through the firewall and the one doesn't are blocked
* Operating systems ship with this type of filtering
* This firewall seperates the packets based upon the parameters of the incoming packet
* Disadvantage: As this type of firewall dont compare the incoming packets with the previous one they are likely be affected by PING Flood / SYN Flood
* Doesn't offer user authentication as it sees only the incoming packet header and has no information about the incoming packet
* Establishing a Packet Filtering Firewall includes configuring which Protcols should be allowed, which source and destibation ports should be allowed, which source IP's should be allowed


[+] STATEFUL PACKET INSPECTION FIREWALL:

* Advanced version of Packet Filtering Firewall, allows the incoming packets based on the firewalls rules set
* This type of firewall examines the data in the current incoming packet and the previous packet used in the conversation
* Examining the packets make this firewall less vulnerable to Ping / SYN Flood and Spoofing attacks
* Quality firewalls mostly uses the SPI method
* Adviced to use this type of firewall, most home routers have the option for SPI method
* SPI firewalls are quite common


[+] APPLICATION GATEWAY:

* Application gateway is a program that runs on a firewall
* This type of firewall will examine the client application with the server-side application to which the appliciation is trying to connect, rather than examining the protocol and port of the packet
* Allows the administrator to provide access to only certain applications
* The connection from the client web client to the server is made via application gateway, the client negotiates with the server to connect to server
* The proxy establishes the connection on behalf of client thus hiding/ protecting other computers in the network behind the firewall
* Connection Syntax:
      >_ Client to Proxy
      >_ Proxy to Server
* The packets are inspected at the proxy and forwards the packets
* Each client requires a unique program to make the connection and communicate with the server
* Provides User Authentication and is used to avoid unwanted incoming packets
* Disadvantage: As it requires an application, consumption of both CPU and MEMORY Usage will be high
* Vulnerable to SYN & PING Flood 
* Requires authentication of both client and server to authenticate thus multiple requests might cause the firewall to operate numb and prevent legitimate users from accessing
* A user can send huge number of requests directly to the server thus flooding and preventing access to legitimate users


[+] CIRCUIT LEVEL GATEWAY:

* Similar to application level gateway in a more secured way and are generally implemented in high end equipments
* User authentication is employed but they are done in an earlier process
* The client application is checked if the access should be granted and the user is authenticated
* Authenticating the users is the first step, the LogOn Id and password is first checked and then the access to the router is established
* The entered IP / Username is first verified before establishing each connection
* Once the connection is made, the bytes are transmitted from the source to the client
* A virtual circuit exists b/w the server and the proxy server
* The request from the internet goes through this proxy server and the response is recieved through the circuit to the internet after changing the IP address
* Only the IP of the proxy server is seen by the external users
* External systems never see the internal systems by this firewall


[+] FIREWALL IMPLEMENTATION:

* Administrators should have a clear understanding of firewall that is implemented
* Understanding the firewall is necessary to know what it allows and what it blocks
* Type of implementation:
      >_ Network Host Based
      >_ Dual Homed Host
      >_ Router Based Firewall
      >_ Screened Host


[+] HOST BASED FIREWALL:

* This is a type of firewall that is installed via a software on the existing system with its OS
* The machine implemented with this type of firewall should have hardened OS
* Hardening OS refers to:
      >_ Patching up-to-date
      >_ Uninstalling un-used / un-wanted utilities
      >_ Closing unused ports
* Installation of applicaion is done in the server, or a server may ship with it
* Cost efficient
* WorkFlow:
      >_ firewall installed on a linux system
      >_ You have a server to protect
      >_ Using the firewall implemented system as a firewall 
      
      
[+] DUAL HOMED HOST:

* Firewall running on a server with atleast two NIC's
* Server acts as a router b/w the network and to the interface which it is attached
* The IP packet from the network is not directly forwarded to the network, since auutomatic routing function is disabled
* The routing path and packets are configured by the SysAdmins
* Depends on the security of the underlying OS


[+] ROUTER BASED FIREWALL:
